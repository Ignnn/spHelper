\title{[!] Calculate summary statistic of spectroscopic data by group and for all data}
\usage{
spStat(sp, by, FUN = mean, Name_of.by = as.character(match.call()$by))
}
\arguments{
\item{sp}{A hyperSpec object.}

\item{by}{A grouping variable (either variable name of \code{sp},
or vector (factor) of length \code{length(sp)}}

\item{FUN}{A function to apply.}

\item{Name_of.by}{(Do not change this.)}
}
\value{
A hyperSpec object that contain summary statistic. Additional
        column \code{.aggregate} is added. In this column levels of
        grouping variable are indicated.
}
\description{
Calculate summary statistic spectra in hyperSpec object by group and for all data
}
\note{
This function is similar to \code{\link[hyperSpec]{aggregate}},
just calculates additional statistic for all spectra. This
statistic is indicated by level \code{.ALL}) in variable
\code{.aggregate}.
}
\examples{
spStat(Spectra, gr)
spStat(Spectra, by = gr,         FUN = IQR)
spStat(Spectra, by = Spectra$gr, FUN = IQR)
